#MNIST CNN Project

This project focuses on developing, improving and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. All steps are implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook file.

1. Baseline CNN Model Development

The initial baseline CNN model is developed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
The model architecture includes convolutional layers, max pooling, flattening, and dense layers.

2. Improved CNN Model Development

The baseline model is enhanced by adding additional convolutional layers for increased complexity.
The model architecture is adjusted to achieve a slightly better performance.

3. Model Evaluation

The saved model is loaded, and its performance is evaluated on the test dataset.


4. Testing on an Unseen Image
5. 
A new image is loaded, preprocessed, and fed to the trained model.
The model successfully predicts the digit in the image, demonstrating its capability on unseen data.
